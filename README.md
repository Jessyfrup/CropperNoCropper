This is a lightweight Image Cropper for Android which also supports no-crop feature.

Which is forked from [jayrambhia/CropperNoCropper](https://github.com/jayrambhia/CropperNoCropper)

## CropperView

It's a FrameLayout which contains a view for Grid and an imageview. This project supports only square cropping.
CropperView contains some basic methods like `setImageBitmap()`, `setMaxZoom()`, `setMinZoom()`, etc which are
forwarded to `CropperImageView`.
